# Emotion-Recognition-Deep-Learning
This project analyzes emotions from images using deep-learning models built with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It includes preprocessing image data, training models, and evaluating their performance. The system predicts emotions through optimized model architecture and advanced machine-learning techniques.
Features
Dataset: The Kaggle dataset includes various labeled images representing different emotional states.
Model Architecture: The deep learning model is designed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Preprocessing: Image data is preprocessed for normalization and augmentation to improve model generalization.
Training and Optimization: The model is trained with techniques like dropout, learning rate scheduling, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance.
Evaluation: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model.
